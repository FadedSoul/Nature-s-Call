# Nature-s-Call
Our very first 2D project in Unity. We had a group of 5 people which consisted out of 2 Developers and 3 Artists. The assignment was to make a fully working 2D Tower Defense game with different towers in 8 weeks. We had a problem with the healthbars not getting on top of the enemies sometimes after a certain amount of time, which we were not able to fix after trying for hours.
